7.2 (Adapted from Barwise and Etchemendy (1993).) Given the following, can you prove
that the unicorn is mythical? How about magical? Horned?

    If the unicorn is mythical, then it is immortal, but if it is not mythical, then it is a
    mortal mammal. If the unicorn is either immortal or a mammal, then it is horned.
    The unicorn is magical if it is horned.

    Mythical:
        Cannot be proved because there is no statment that has "mythical" as it's outcome.
    
    Magical:
        methods of proving:
            horned(X) -> magical(X)
            immortal(X) ^ mammal(X) -> horned(X) -> magical(X)
            ~mythical(X) -> mammal(X)  -> horned(X) -> magical(X)

        Based on the given satements, if we have the knowldege that either the unicorn is horned, not mythical, immortal, or a mammal then we can prove that it is magical. 
    

    Horned:
        immortal(X) ^ mammal(X) -> horned(X)
        ~mythical(X) -> mammal(X)  -> horned(X) 

        Based on the given satements, if we have the knowldege that either the unicorn is immortal, a mammal, or not mythical then we can prove that it is horned.


    prolog:
        There are only 4 major statments given for us to program:
        1) isMythical -> isImmortal
        2) ~isMythical -> isMortal ^ isMammal
        3) isMortal v isMammal -> isHorned
        4) isImmortal -> isMagical 

        these are all relatiely simple to program in prolog with the exception of statment 2. We have not formally learned a "not" statement, but after a quick google search, I dsicovered that negation can be a little tricky in prolog. But they have built in a system to program it.

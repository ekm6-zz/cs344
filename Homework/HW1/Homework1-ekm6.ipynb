    "\tIntrospection is far to subjective and unique to each individual for researches to use for modeling those processes. As much as someone may try to be objective, what one perceives of the of themselves and the world is so carefully curated to their own experiences. Naturally, to take take these observations and attempt to make model general human cognitive processes is both difficult and impractical. It would be far more practical and successful for an outside body (meaning not the subject) to develop a standard for measuring and interpreting these processes. "

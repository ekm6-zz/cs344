Exercise 1.1

b)

	i. function
	ii. list
	iii. yes, achieve_all() calls achieve() which calls calls apply_operator(), which calls calls achieve_all() again, making it recursive.

d)
	i. this models the monkey and banana problem. 
		Rules: a hungry monkey is in a room. Bananas have been hung from the center of the ceiling of the room.In the corner of the room there is a chair. the monkey can move things aroun cary things, wave a stick in the air, and reach for the bananas

	This code faithfully models that problem. The only variation is that the monkey starts with a ball in its' hand. 

	ii. This mechanism uses means-end analysis. It defines the initial state, goal state, and a list of operators (actions, pre-conditions, and post-conditions).
		It then it does a search back from the goal state trying to reach the starting state.  

	iii. Yes, it fits the definitions of intelligence that deal with rationality. It acts ("moving" the blocks), and thinks rationally (finding a way to move the blocks to reach goal state).

	iv. Yes, it would be displaying rationality

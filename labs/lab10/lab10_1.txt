Exercise 1

A:
  I would rathers use keras. It feels more intuitive in the way that we set up each layer. You can "see" the layer in your code and have (in my opinion) a more intuitive way to modify it or remove it.

B:
  Hyperparameters:
    learning_rate=0.005,
    steps=10000,
    batch_size=100,
    hidden_units=[10, 5, 3],

  Performance:
    Final RMSE (on training data):   100.52
    Final RMSE (on validation data): 101.66
    Final RMSE (on test data): 99.32

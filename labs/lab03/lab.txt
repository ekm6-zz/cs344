Exercise 3.1
    
    a) 
        Depth first search doesn't work even on the easy one. That's because
        it has way too many options to look through. DPS searches every possible
        path to find the solution, which is horribly inefficient. It takes 86
        seconds to give up and fail.

        AC3 runs very quickly, printing its results in fractions of a second.
        It the constraints for each "step" or "move". If the move is determined
        to be invalid or "inconsistent" with the goal state, it removes it from
        the queue of available moves. This allows the algorithm to "infer" the 
        correct solution. Which works better for simple solution. For more
        complex problems, it is necessary to search for the solution, which thus
        algorithm does not do.

        Back-Tracking is simular to Depth first search in some implementations.
        It checks possible values and back tracks if the choice doesn't produce
        a valid outcome. Without forward checking, this runs fairly slowly, slo-
        er than AC3 because it's running a search. It isn't able to solve any
        problems that the other algorithms can't (stops working after the easy
         example).

        Min-conflics is a local search algorithm implemented with hill-climbing.
        It seemingly took longer on the simpler problems as oposed to the back-
        tracking and AC3 algorithms. However, on the harder soduko example, it
        was the only one that was able to solve the problem within my time con-
        straints (3 minutes). It also solved the hardets one in the same amount
        of time. Min-conflicts performs better when there are are many options
        because unlike back-tracking, it doesn't search through every options.

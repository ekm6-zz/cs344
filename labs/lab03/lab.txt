Exercise 3.1

    a) 
        Depth first search doesn't work even on the easy one. That's because
        it has way too many options to look through. DPS searches every possible
        path to find the solution, which is horribly inefficient. It takes 86
        seconds to give up and fail.

        AC3 runs very quickly, printing its results in fractions of a second.
        It the constraints for each "step" or "move". If the move is determined
        to be invalid or "inconsistent" with the goal state, it removes it from
        the queue of available moves. This allows the algorithm to "infer" the 
        correct solution. Which works better for simple solution. For more
        complex problems, it is necessary to search for the solution, which thus
        algorithm does not do.

        Back-Tracking is similar to Depth first search in some implementations.
        It checks possible values and back tracks if the choice doesn't produce
        a valid outcome. Without forward checking, this runs fairly slowly, slo-
        er than AC3 because it's running a search. It isn't able to solve any
        problems that the other algorithms can't (stops working after the easy
         example).

        Min-conflicts is a local search algorithm implemented with hill-climbing.
        It seemingly took longer on the simpler problems as opposed to the back-
        tracking and AC3 algorithms. However, on the harder sudoku example, it
        was the only one that was able to solve the problem within my time con-
        straints (3 minutes). It also solved the hardest one in the same amount
        of time. Min-conflicts performs better when there are are many options
        because unlike back-tracking, it doesn't search through every options.

    b)

        Back-tracking runs fastest with the combination of both forward checking
        and the option to choose the next unassigned variable by minimum-remaining
        -values. Forward checking eliminates options before the algorithm has to
        look at them using AC3 mechanisms. Choosing by minimum-remaining-values 
        speeds up the algorithm because it takes less time to search through less
        options. Furthermore, solving the 'simpler' variables also eliminates possible
        values from the variables with more options.

Exercise 3.2
    a)
        AC3 could never solve the problem. AC3 limits the search space, but then
        doesn't follow up with a search. Even with the pruned paths, n-queens is
        too complex to solve without at search.

        Back tracking was able to solve the problem within reasonable time until
        N grew to past 25 or so. without changing any settings, backtracking brute
        forces a solution, checking every option in sequence. When other settings
        (the ones suggested) were applied, it was able to run more efficiently. 

        min conflicts was able solve almost as many as back tracking, assuming
        the step size as large enough. 


    b) 


Exercise 3.3

    a) 
    Traditional search problems in some ways have more simple specifications.
    They specify goals, actions, and starting states then the algorithm takes
    care of the rest. CSP problems also specify goals, and actions (called domains
    in this context). However, CSP problems also define neighbors  and constraints.

    Search problems are concerned with the process. They calculate things like path
    cost and keeps track of the series of steps it takes to get there. CSP problems
    are more so concerned with large domains

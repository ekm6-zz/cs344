Exercise 3.1
    
    a) 
        Depth first search doesn't work even on the easy one. That's because
        it has way too many options to look through. DPS searches every possible
        path to find the solution, which is horribly inefficient. It takes 86
        seconds to give up and fail.

        AC3 runs very quickly, printing its results in fractions of a second.
        It the constraints for each "step" or "move". If the move is determined
        to be invalid or "inconsistent" with the goal state, it removes it from
        the queue of available moves. This allows the algorithm to "infer" the 
        correct solution. Which works better for simple solution. For more
        complex problems, it is necessary to search for the solution, which thus
        algorithm does not do.

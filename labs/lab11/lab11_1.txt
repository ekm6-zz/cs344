Exercise 1:

Questions:
  a) Linear models are better when we have a small dataset. NN need larger datasets.

  2) Linear models fall short when there are non-linearities in the data. NN will be able to capture patterns more effectively.

  3) Embeddings make sentiment analysis far more computationally efficient. Sparse matrcies are so wide, so training and fitting models takes a long time. Embedining will "shrink" those matrices to just a few columns wide, typically withought hurting performance.

  4) "Bad" and "awful" have similar embeddings becuase they can be interchanged in a sentence without the sentence losing it's meaning.They're both something you'd find in a negative context.

Exercise 3

    A:
        Task #1:
            california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"] / california_housing_dataframe["population"]

            calibration_data = train_model(
                learning_rate=0.00005,
                steps=500,
                batch_size=5,
                input_feature="rooms_per_person"
            )
            
            
        Task #2:
            
            plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])
            plt.show()
        
        Task #3:
            
            california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = (
    california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"]).apply(lambda x: min(x, 3))
    
    B:
        Using snythetic features can give models new useful features without needing to get more data. In some cases (the ideal ones), the resulting synthetic feature can create a more accurate model than the features that were used to create it. Like in this exercies, rooms per person created a better model than total_rooms and population.
        
    C:
        outliers are values in the data that differ significantly from the rest of the data. They are usually excluded from calculations because including them would sqew the model.

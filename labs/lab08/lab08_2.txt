Exercise 2:
  A:

    The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the relationship between a variable and it's target. In other words, it measures what happnes to varibale b as varible a increases. For example, population has a nearly perfect correlation with households. It  make sense that areas larger populations have more homes.

  B:
    Task 1:
      selected features: median_income, rooms_per_person

      hyperparameters:
        learning_rate=0.05,
        steps=500,
        batch_size=5

      Final RMSE: 84.63, this beat google's solution (112.23)

    Task 2:
      def select_and_transform_features(source_df):
        selected_examples = pd.DataFrame()
        selected_examples["median_income"] = source_df["median_income"]
        selected_examples["rooms_per_person"] = source_df["rooms_per_person"]
        selected_examples["distance_from_san_francisco"] = source_df["latitude"] -38
        return selected_examples

      hyperparameters:
        learning_rate=0.05,
        steps=500,
        batch_size=5

      Final RMSE: 82.97, this performs pretty closely to google's solution (82.2)

Exercise 2

    a) Framing
        1. 
            We ant the Machine Learned model to determine whether or not a
            given email is "important".
        2.
            Our ideal outcome is for the model to label email as important only
            when they are time sensitive.
        3.
            a) Our success metrics are the percentage of emails correctly labeled
                on a testing set of emails.
            
            b) Our Key results for the success metrics are for the model to label
                the emails correctly at a rate of 95% or higher.
            
            c) Our model is deemed a failure if the model fails to achieve an accuracy
                of at least 65%.
        4.
            a) The output from our ML model will be the label of the email

            b) The output is defined as 1 for important and 0 for unimportant.

        5.
            a) The output from the ML model will be made at the arrival of a new email.
        
            b) The outcome will be used for labeling the email as "important". 
        6.
            If we didn't use ML, we would make a selection based on:
                - sender
                -time of day
                -message content (look for words suggesting urgency)
        
    b) Formulating
        7.
            Our problem is best framed as a "Binary Classification" which predicts
            whether or not an email is important.
        8. 
            rows --> emails
            output --> label (1 or 0)
            
        9.
            all of the following inputs are easy to obtain, from the email
            itself: 
                - sender
                - isResponse?
                - time sent
                - number of characters
                - subject
        10. 
            a reasonable model could be made using sender and subject.
